--> BONUS 

-->for bonus , I prepared a function calculator_fare just before the journey planner function which is integrated with ride journey planner. ( choice no. 2)
--> It calculates journey fair at 11 rupees per station , excluding the source station obviously, in all cases.


--> Extra fare in case of Interchanges is not taken into account because the code was going very complex for me.

Example:
so if you wish to go from Laxmi Nagar to Kakarduma , the fair would be 3*11 = 33 rupees since there are 3 total stations(Nirman vihar , preet vihar , karkarduma )

# Program is run from the terminal
# Sample Test Cases
